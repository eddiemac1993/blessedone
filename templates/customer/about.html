        <h2>Delivery Application</h2>
        <p>
          In addition to the about page, our website offers a delivery application where customers can place their orders for delivery. Here's how it works:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to the menu and browse the items available for ordering.</li>
          <li>Select the items you want by clicking the small box next to each item.</li>
          <li>Fill out the form with your name, reference ID (if applicable), delivery location, and delivery fee.</li>
          <li>Submit your order by clicking the "Submit Order" button.</li>
          <li>A confirmation drop-down menu will appear to verify your order.</li>
          <li>If everything is correct, you can download the invoice if you wish, but you'll still need to complete the transaction by sending the order through the WhatsApp button.</li>
          <li>Our orders are cash on delivery, so you'll pay when the delivery is made.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you have any questions or concerns, our support team is always available to help. Thank you for using our delivery application!
